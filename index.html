				<h2><a href="./FlyingTable.html">Flying Table</a></h2>
				<p>After teaching myself WebGL in preparation for my capstone project WikiNatural, I made... this to demonstrate everything I'd learned.</p>

				<h2><a href="./Icosahedron.html">Icosahedron</a></h2>
				<p>The first project in an Introduction to Computer Graphics course I took involved generating an icosahedron in three different ways, using the Geometry, IcosahedronGeometry, and PolyhedronGeometry classes in THREE.js.</p>
			</div>

				<h2><a href="./HeightField.html">Height Field</a></h2>
				<p>In another project in Introduction to Computer Graphics, I generated height fields using the recursive and iterative diamond-square algorithm and grayscale images. You can read more about the diamond-square algorithm in this demo <a href="https://gatesmediablog.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/heightfieldproject.pdf">here</a>.</p>

				<h2><a href="./DiscoTree.html">Disco Forest</a></h2>
				<p>This Introduction to Computer Graphics project required us to generate randomized trees and forests using only cylinders. It also required us to use different types of lights, so I made a disco forest. It goes well with some Daft Punk.</p>

				<h2><a href="./Snowman.html">Snowman</a></h2>
				<p>I wanted to experiment with object parenting and rigging in this Introduction to Computer Graphics project inspired by Disney's <em>Frozen</em>. You can read more about the rig in this project <a href="https://gatesmediablog.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/snowmanproject.pdf">here</a>.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="project">
				<h2><a href="./IKRig.html">IK-Rig</a></h2>
				<p>For the final project in Introduction to Computer Graphics, I continued experimenting with rigging by creating the basics of an IK-Rig for an arm or leg. You can read more about the mathematics and rig behind this demo <a href="https://gatesmediablog.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/ikrigproject.pdf">here</a>.</p>

				<h2><a href="https://silentfuzzle.github.io/WikiNatural/">WikiNatural</a></h2>
				<p>WikiNatural was my capstone project as an undergraduate Computer Science student. I contributed to the map layout, panel layout, user interface controls, and animations. You can learn more about WikiNatural <a href="https://gatesmediablog.wordpress.com/software/wikinatural/">here</a>.</p>
