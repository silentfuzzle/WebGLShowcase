WebGL and three.js Demos
==========================

I created this series of WebGL and three.js projects for a couple classes as an undergraduate student. Topics I explored include procedural generation, animation, and rigging. See the home page live [here](https://silentfuzzle.github.io/WebGLShowcase/) for more information and links to the demos.
