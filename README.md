WebGL and THREE.js Demos
==========================

These are a series of WebGL and THREE.js projects that I created for a couple classes as an undergraduate student. Topics I explored include procedural generation, animation, and rigging. See the home page live [here](https://silentfuzzle.github.io/WebGLShowcase/) for more information about each project.
